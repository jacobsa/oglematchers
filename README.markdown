This project is an attempt to create a unit testing framework for Go with the
following features:

 *  An extensive and extensible set of matchers for expressing expectations.
 *  Clean, readable output that tells you exaclty what you need to know.
 *  Style and semantics similar to [Google Test][googletest] and
    [Google JS Test][google-js-test].

It is not yet ready for general use.
